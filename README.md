# Octroi_credit
This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a loan applicant is likely to repay a loan or default. The objective is to assist financial institutions in making informed credit granting decisions and reducing the risk of unpaid loans.

# Problem Statement
Financial institutions face challenges when it comes to assessing whether a customer is creditworthy. Using historical data and machine learning algorithms, this project predicts the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan, based on personal and financial information.

# Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas, NumPy (Data preprocessing)
Scikit-learn (Modeling & evaluation)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data visualization)
Google collab Notebook
Gjango for app deployment
